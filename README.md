A simple HTML/JS page that uses [Tabletop](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) and [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) to turn a hard to read Google Spreadsheet of SFPC applications into a document that's easier to review and/or print.

Since there are a lot of variables in here specific to our spreadsheet, this code is probably useful only to us ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ but I'm sharing it — mostly so that future-me can find it, instead of whipping up a similar page each time.

1. In the spreadsheet: Google Docs > File > Publish to the web...
2. Paste the URL into YOUR-KEY-HERE
3. Load the page
4. Save results as HTML and PDF for sending around to reviewers
5. Unpublish the spreadsheet
5. Make the school!!
